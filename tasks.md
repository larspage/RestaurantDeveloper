- **Import Preview**: Show changes before applying imports
- **CSV Support**: Basic CSV import functionality
- **Shopping Cart Integration**: Handle price point selection in cart
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing single-price items continue to work

### Implementation Approach
The project uses a **Level 1 task breakdown strategy**:
- Each task has a single, clear objective
- Simple implementation with minimal complexity
- Independent tasks that can be completed individually
- Clear success criteria and testable outcomes
- Low risk with minimal impact on existing functionality

### Total Estimated Timeline: 7.5 days
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Foundation (2 days) - COMPLETED
- ‚è≥ **Phase 2**: Import/Export (2.5 days) - READY TO START
- ‚è≥ **Phase 3**: Integration (2 days) - PENDING
- ‚è≥ **Phase 4**: Enhancement (1 day) - PENDING

### Documentation
Comprehensive planning and implementation details are documented in:
- `docs/json_import_export_price_points_plan.md`

## Original Complexity Assessment: Level 3
The overall menu management implementation was Level 3 complexity due to:
- Complex UI interactions (drag and drop, image uploads)
- Data validation requirements
- Performance considerations for large menus
- Integration with multiple backend endpoints

**Current Status**: Level 3 implementation completed and production-ready ‚úÖ
