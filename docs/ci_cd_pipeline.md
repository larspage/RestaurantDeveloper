# CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment Strategy

## Overview  
This document outlines the **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** for Mr. Brooks Restaurant Creator, ensuring automated testing, secure check-ins, and controlled deployments to **DigitalOcean**.

---

## Core CI/CD Principles  
âœ… **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Enforcement** â€“ Every change must pass all tests before check-in.  
âœ… **Local Development First** â€“ Code is tested locally before deployment.  
âœ… **Automated Testing via GitHub Actions** â€“ Ensuring clean commits and merges.  
âœ… **Manual Deployment Trigger to DigitalOcean** â€“ Prevent unnecessary cost-incurring updates.  
âœ… **Rollback Strategy** â€“ Failed deployments revert to the last stable version.

## Development & Testing Flow  
### **1. Local Development**
- All development happens **locally** until the website is practically complete.  
- Feature branches created for **each individual 1-point change**.  

### **2. Pre-Commit Hook for Local Testing**
- Before committing, all tests **must pass locally**.  
- Uses **Jest & Supertest for API validation**, **Cypress for E2E testing**.  

### **3. GitHub Actions Workflow (Continuous Integration)**
- Runs unit & integration tests **automatically** on every branch push.  
- Prevents merging until **all tests pass**.

## Deployment Process (Controlled via GitHub Actions)  
### **4. Staging Before Production Deployment**
- Once a feature is complete, a **staging branch** is used for final verification.  
- **Only stable, verified code moves to production deployment**.  

### **5. Manual Deployment Trigger to DigitalOcean**
- Deployment **only occurs when ready**, avoiding unnecessary update costs.  
- Uses **Dockerized builds** for streamlined deployment.  

### **6. Automated Rollback on Failure**
- If deployment fails, system **auto-reverts to last stable version**.  
- Error logs tracked for debugging.

## GitHub Repository Configuration  
### **Repository:** [larspage/RestaurantDeveloper](https://github.com/larspage/RestaurantDeveloper)  
### **Branching Strategy**
âœ… **Feature branches** for individual 1-point changes.  
âœ… **Main branch remains stable, only updated after full verification**.  
âœ… **Staging branch used for final testing before production deployment**.  

---

## Security Measures in CI/CD  
### **7. Role-Based Access Control**
- Only verified contributors can trigger production deployments.  
- API keys and sensitive credentials **encrypted via GitHub Secrets**.  

### **8. Automated Vulnerability Scanning**
- **GitHub Dependabot scans dependencies** for security risks.  
- **API endpoints validated for unauthorized access attempts**.

## Future Enhancements  
âœ… **Load Testing for High Traffic Scenarios** ðŸš€  
âœ… **Automated Performance Benchmarking** ðŸ“¡  
âœ… **Enhanced Monitoring for Real-Time Issue Detection** ðŸ”§

### **Final Notes**
This **CI/CD pipeline ensures structured check-ins, controlled deployments, and cost-efficient management**, keeping the platform scalable and secure. ðŸš€
