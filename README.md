## 🚀 Setup Guide  
1️⃣ Clone the repository:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/larspage/RestaurantDeveloper.git
```

2️⃣ Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

3️⃣ Start the development servers (includes MinIO for image storage):
```sh
npm run dev:all
```

4️⃣ Stop the development servers:
```sh
npm run stop
```

## 📸 Image Storage with MinIO
This project uses MinIO for image storage in development. The `dev:all` script automatically:

1. Checks if Docker is running
2. Starts MinIO if it's not already running
3. Provides information about the MinIO console

To manually manage MinIO:
```sh
# Start MinIO and create the required bucket
npm run setup:minio

# Access the MinIO console
# URL: http://localhost:9001
# Username: minioadmin
# Password: minioadmin
```

If you encounter issues with image uploads:
1. Make sure Docker is running
2. Check that the "restaurant-menu-images" bucket exists in MinIO
3. Set the bucket's access policy to "public" for development purposes
