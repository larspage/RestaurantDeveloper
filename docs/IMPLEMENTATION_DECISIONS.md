## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS**

### **1. Theme Management Architecture**
**Decision Made:** Separate Theme collection with restaurant references

**Original Plan:** Simple string field in Restaurant model (`theme: "modern-dark"`)

**Final Implementation:**
- **Theme Collection** - Predefined, reusable themes with full styling definitions
- **Restaurant Model** - References theme by `theme_id` (ObjectId)
- **Theme Structure** - Colors, fonts, layout styles all defined in theme document

**Rationale:**
- **Reusability** - Multiple restaurants can use the same theme
- **Maintainability** - Theme updates apply to all restaurants using that theme
- **Extensibility** - Easy to add new themes without touching restaurant data
- **Developer/User Friendly** - Themes have both `name` (developer) and `displayName` (user)

**Alternative Considered:** Inline theme object in restaurant document (rejected due to data duplication)

---

### **2. Menu Structure Design**
**Decision Made:** Structured sections approach with embedded items

**Original Plan:** Flat array of menu items with category strings

**Final Implementation:**
```javascript
{
  restaurant_id: "UUID",
  sections: [
    {
      name: "Breakfast",
      displayOrder: 1,
      items: [
        { name: "Pancakes", price: 8.99, customizations: [...] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **MongoDB Optimized** - Single document queries, atomic updates
- **UI Mapping** - Direct correspondence to frontend section rendering
- **Ordering Control** - `displayOrder` field for flexible section arrangement
- **Performance** - No complex joins needed for menu retrieval
- **Section Management** - Easy to add/remove/reorder entire menu sections

**Alternative Considered:** Separate MenuSection collection (rejected due to query complexity)

---

### **3. User Data Storage Strategy**
**Decision Made:** Hybrid approach with minimal duplication

**Original Plan:** Unclear split between Supabase and MongoDB for user data

**Final Implementation:**
- **Supabase** - Authentication, email, password, contact information
- **MongoDB User Model** - Cached name, role, restaurant_id, preferences
- **Minimal Duplication** - Only essential fields duplicated for performance

**Rationale:**
- **Performance** - Avoid Supabase queries for every API request
- **Data Integrity** - Auth data stays in Supabase where it belongs
- **Flexibility** - User preferences and app-specific data in MongoDB
- **Sync Strategy** - `last_sync` field to manage data consistency

**Alternative Considered:** All user data in Supabase (rejected due to query performance)

---

### **4. Order Status Workflow**
**Decision Made:** Kitchen-focused status progression

**Original Plan:** Basic "pending" and "completed" statuses

**Final Implementation:**
```javascript
enum: ['received', 'confirmed', 'in_kitchen', 'ready_for_pickup', 'delivered', 'cancelled']
```

**Rationale:**
- **Kitchen Operations** - Matches real restaurant workflow
- **Customer Communication** - Clear status for order tracking
- **Operational Efficiency** - Supports kitchen management systems
- **Extensibility** - Easy to add more statuses if needed

**Alternative Considered:** Simple 3-status system (rejected as too basic for real use)

---

### **5. Guest Order Handling**
**Decision Made:** Embedded guest_info in Order model

**Original Plan:** Require user accounts for all orders

**Final Implementation:**
```javascript
{
  customer_id: null, // for guest orders
  guest_info: {
    name: "John Doe",
    phone: "555-1234",
    email: "john@example.com"
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **User Experience** - No forced account creation
- **Conversion** - Lower barrier to first order
- **Data Integrity** - Contact info preserved for guest orders
- **Future Migration** - Easy to link guest orders to accounts later

**Alternative Considered:** Separate GuestOrder collection (rejected due to complexity)

---

## üîß **TECHNICAL DECISIONS**

### **6. Authentication Middleware Strategy**
**Decision Made:** JWT verification with MongoDB user lookup

**Implementation:**
- **Token Verification** - Supabase validates JWT token
- **User Enrichment** - MongoDB lookup for cached user data
- **Request Context** - Attach full user object to `req.user`

**Rationale:**
- **Performance** - Single middleware handles auth + user data
- **Security** - Supabase manages token lifecycle
- **Convenience** - Controllers have immediate access to user info

---

### **7. Error Handling Strategy**
**Decision Made:** Centralized error middleware with specific error types

**Implementation:**
- **Mongoose Validation** - Automatic validation error formatting
- **Duplicate Key Errors** - User-friendly duplicate field messages
- **Generic Fallback** - Secure error responses for unexpected errors

**Rationale:**
- **Consistency** - All errors formatted the same way
- **Security** - No sensitive information leaked
- **Developer Experience** - Clear error messages for debugging

---

### **8. Testing Strategy**
**Decision Made:** Mock Supabase for unit tests

**Implementation:**
- **Jest Mocks** - Complete Supabase client mocking
- **Isolated Tests** - No external dependencies in test suite
- **Test Database** - Separate MongoDB instance for testing

**Rationale:**
- **Speed** - No network calls during testing
- **Reliability** - Tests don't depend on external services
- **Isolation** - Each test runs in clean environment

---

## üìä **DATA MODELING DECISIONS**

### **9. MongoDB Schema Design**
**Decision Made:** Embedded documents for related data

**Examples:**
- **Menu Items** - Embedded in sections (not separate collection)
- **Order Items** - Embedded in orders (not separate collection)
- **Theme Properties** - Embedded objects for colors, fonts, layout

**Rationale:**
- **Query Performance** - Single document retrieval
- **Atomic Operations** - Related data updates together
- **Data Locality** - Related information stored together

---

### **10. Indexing Strategy**
**Decision Made:** Strategic indexes for common query patterns

**Implemented Indexes:**
- **Restaurant queries** - `restaurant_id` on Menu, Order collections
- **User lookups** - `supabase_id` on User collection
- **Order tracking** - `customer_id`, `status` on Order collection

**Rationale:**
- **Performance** - Fast queries for common operations
- **Scalability** - Efficient as data volume grows
- **Cost Effective** - Only index what's actually queried

---

### **13. Menu JSON Import/Export**
**Decision Made:** Support AI-generated menu content via JSON import

**Implementation:**
- **Standardized JSON Format** - Clear structure for sections and items
- **Validation Layer** - Client and server-side schema validation
- **Two-way Conversion** - Both import and export functionality
- **AI Integration Ready** - Format compatible with LLM-generated content

**Rationale:**
- **Efficiency** - Rapid menu creation from external sources
- **AI Compatibility** - Easy to use AI-generated menu suggestions
- **Data Portability** - Simple migration from other systems
- **User Experience** - Reduces manual data entry for restaurant owners

**Alternative Considered:** CSV import (rejected due to hierarchical structure complexity)

---

### **14. File Upload Component**
- **Decision**: Replaced a buggy, custom-built file uploader with the `react-dropzone` library.
- **Rationale**: The custom solution was unreliable and caused numerous bugs (e.g., file dialog not opening, incorrect data URLs being sent to the server). `react-dropzone` is a stable, well-maintained library that provides a better user experience, including drag-and-drop, and solved all outstanding file input issues.
- **Implementation**: Created a reusable `ImageUploader.tsx` component that wraps `react-dropzone`. This component handles file selection, previews, and validation. It was then integrated into the `MenuItemForm`.
- **Impact**: Dramatically increased the stability and usability of the menu management feature.

### **15. Project Dependency Management**
- **Decision**: Converted the project to a monorepo using **npm Workspaces**.
- **Rationale**: The project has separate `frontend` and `backend` packages with interdependencies. The previous setup, using `file:` links in `package.json`, caused persistent and hard-to-debug module resolution errors (e.g., "Module not found" for `react-dropzone`). npm Workspaces is the standard, modern solution for managing monorepos.
- **Implementation**: Modified the root `package.json` to define the `frontend` and `backend` workspaces. Removed the direct `file:` link from the `frontend` package. All installations are now run from the root directory.
- **Impact**: Permanently stabilized the development environment, resolved all dependency and module resolution issues, and established a standard, scalable monorepo architecture for the project.

---

### **16. Database Seeding for Development**
- **Decision**: Created a centralized, repeatable database seeding script.
- **Rationale**: Manual testing and UI development were hampered by inconsistent or non-existent data. Previous attempts to fix a complex and broken test suite proved to be a time sink. A reliable seeding script provides a "known good state" for the database, allowing developers to build and test features against a consistent set of users, restaurants, menus, and orders. This approach unblocks UI development from the broken test suite.
- **Implementation**: A new script, `backend/scripts/seed.js`, was created. It connects to the database, clears existing test data, and populates the collections with a rich, interconnected dataset. An `npm run seed` command was added to `backend/package.json` for easy execution.
- **Impact**: Greatly improved development velocity. Developers can now instantly reset the database to a full, predictable state, making UI development and manual testing much more efficient and reliable.

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT DECISIONS**

### **11. Environment Configuration**
**Decision Made:** Environment-based configuration with defaults

**Implementation:**
- **Development defaults** - Local MongoDB, localhost frontend
- **Production overrides** - Environment variables for all external services
- **Security** - Separate service keys for different environments

**Rationale:**
- **Developer Experience** - Easy local setup
- **Security** - Production secrets not in code
- **Flexibility** - Easy to deploy to different environments

---

## üìù **DOCUMENTATION DECISIONS**

### **12. Status Tracking**
**Decision Made:** Dedicated PROJECT_STATUS.md with regular updates

**Implementation:**
- **Progress percentages** - Clear completion tracking
- **Phase-based organization** - Logical development progression
- **Regular updates** - Status updated with each major milestone

**Rationale:**
- **Transparency** - Clear progress visibility
- **Planning** - Helps prioritize next steps
- **Accountability** - Tracks what's actually completed

---

## üîÑ **DECISIONS PENDING**

### **Items Still To Be Decided:**
1. **Frontend State Management** - Redux vs Context API vs Zustand
2. **Image Storage** - Supabase Storage vs AWS S3 vs DigitalOcean Spaces
3. **Payment Processing** - Stripe vs Square vs PayPal integration
4. **Real-time Updates** - WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events vs Polling
5. **Caching Strategy** - Redis vs in-memory vs database-level caching

---

## üìö **LESSONS LEARNED**

### **What Worked Well:**
- **Incremental Decision Making** - Addressing one gap at a time
- **Documentation First** - Clear specs led to better implementation
- **Test-Driven Development** - Caught issues early in development

### **What We'd Do Differently:**
- **Earlier Status Tracking** - Should have created PROJECT_STATUS.md sooner
- **Decision Documentation** - This document should have been created from the start
