   - Created `MenuItemForm` component for item editing with image upload
   - Integrated components with the main menu management page

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Components
1. **MenuSectionList.tsx**
   - Implements drag-and-drop using React DnD
   - Handles section reordering and updates to the backend
   - Provides inline editing for section descriptions

2. **DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx**
   - Displays a modal confirmation dialog for delete operations
   - Shows impact summary (e.g., number of items affected)
   - Provides clear cancel and confirm options

3. **MenuItemForm.tsx**
   - Provides form fields for editing menu items
   - Implements image upload with preview functionality
   - Handles file selection and validation
   - Shows upload progress with visual indicator

### Service Enhancements
1. **menuService.ts**
   - Added `updateSectionOrder` method to handle section reordering
   - Enhanced `MenuSection` interface to include order property
   - Enhanced `MenuItem` interface to support image upload properties
   - Added `uploadItemImage` method with progress tracking
   - Added comprehensive tests for all new functionality

### Backend API Enhancements

   - Implemented file upload using multer middleware
   - Added S3 client integration for storing images
   - Updated Menu model to include imageUrl field

### UI/UX Improvements
1. **Section Management**
   - Visual indicators for drag operations
   - Inline editing for section descriptions
   - Improved delete confirmation with impact summary

2. **Item Management**
   - Image upload with drag-and-drop support
   - Upload progress visualization
   - Image preview with delete option
   - Form validation for required fields

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Menu Item Management
1. ✅ Implement item image upload functionality
   - ✅ Create service layer for image uploads
   - ✅ Create ImageUploader component with preview
   - ✅ Integrate with menu item form
   - ✅ Implement backend API endpoint for image uploads
2. ✅ Add item modification options
3. ✅ Implement item availability toggle with visual indicator

### Priority 2: JSON Import/Export Enhancements
1. Add schema validation with detailed error messages
2. Implement preview functionality before import
3. Add support for importing from various formats (CSV, etc.)

### Priority 3: Integration Testing
1. Create Cypress tests for menu management workflows
2. Verify frontend-backend integration for menu operations
3. Test error handling and edge cases

## Conclusion
The menu management implementation has been significantly enhanced with improved error handling, section reordering functionality, and a better user experience for section and item management. We've successfully implemented image upload functionality with progress tracking, preview, and seamless integration with S3-compatible storage. The next phase will focus on enhancing the JSON import/export functionality and implementing comprehensive integration testing.
