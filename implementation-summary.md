4. **Storage Integration**
   - Implemented MinIO for local development image storage
   - Configured for seamless transition to DigitalOcean Spaces in production
   - Added S3 client integration with environment-specific configuration
   - Created bucket policies for public read access to uploaded images

### UI Enhancements
1. **Menu Section Management**
   - Implemented drag-and-drop functionality for section reordering using React DnD
   - Added inline editing for section descriptions with save/cancel options
   - Created modal confirmation dialog for section deletion with item count warning

2. **Menu Item Management**
   - Implemented image upload functionality with progress tracking
   - Created image preview component with delete option
   - Added support for drag-and-drop file uploads
   - Implemented item editing with form validation

3. **Component Structure**
   - Created reusable `MenuSectionList` component for section management
   - Implemented `DeleteConfirmationModal` for improved user experience
   - Created `MenuItemForm` component for item editing with image upload
   - Integrated components with the main menu management page

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Components
1. **MenuSectionList.tsx**
   - Implements drag-and-drop using React DnD
   - Handles section reordering and updates to the backend
   - Provides inline editing for section descriptions

2. **DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx**
   - Displays a modal confirmation dialog for delete operations
   - Shows impact summary (e.g., number of items affected)
   - Provides clear cancel and confirm options

3. **MenuItemForm.tsx**
   - Provides form fields for editing menu items
   - Implements image upload with preview functionality
   - Handles file selection and validation
   - Shows upload progress with visual indicator

### Service Enhancements
1. **menuService.ts**
   - Added `updateSectionOrder` method to handle section reordering
   - Enhanced `MenuSection` interface to include order property
   - Enhanced `MenuItem` interface to support image upload properties
   - Added `uploadItemImage` method with progress tracking
   - Added comprehensive tests for all new functionality

### Backend API Enhancements
1. **Image Upload Endpoint**
   - Added `POST /menus/:restaurant_id/sections/:section_id/items/:item_id/image` endpoint
   - Implemented file upload using multer middleware
   - Added S3 client integration for storing images
   - Updated Menu model to include imageUrl field

### UI/UX Improvements
1. **Section Management**
   - Visual indicators for drag operations
   - Inline editing for section descriptions
   - Improved delete confirmation with impact summary

2. **Item Management**
   - Image upload with drag-and-drop support
   - Upload progress visualization
   - Image preview with delete option
   - Form validation for required fields

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Menu Item Management
1. ✅ Implement item image upload functionality
   - ✅ Create service layer for image uploads
   - ✅ Create ImageUploader component with preview
   - ✅ Integrate with menu item form
   - ✅ Implement backend API endpoint for image uploads
2. ✅ Add item modification options
3. ✅ Implement item availability toggle with visual indicator

### Priority 2: JSON Import/Export Enhancements
1. Add schema validation with detailed error messages
2. Implement preview functionality before import
3. Add support for importing from various formats (CSV, etc.)

### Priority 3: Integration Testing
1. Create Cypress tests for menu management workflows
2. Verify frontend-backend integration for menu operations
3. Test error handling and edge cases

## Conclusion
The menu management implementation has been significantly enhanced with improved error handling, section reordering functionality, and a better user experience for section and item management. We've successfully implemented image upload functionality with progress tracking, preview, and seamless integration with S3-compatible storage. The next phase will focus on enhancing the JSON import/export functionality and implementing comprehensive integration testing.

# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the key implementation details, decisions, and fixes applied to the project.

## Feature: Robust File Uploader

### Problem
The existing file upload functionality was custom-built and suffered from several issues:
- It generated extremely long base64 data URLs for image previews, which were inefficient and sometimes sent to the server.
- The file input dialog would not open reliably across all user interactions.
- The backend server would crash due to `nodemon` incorrectly watching for file uploads instead of source code changes.
- The file type validation was buggy, incorrectly rejecting valid image formats like PNGs.

### Solution
A comprehensive solution was implemented:
1.  **Switched to a Dedicated Library**: The custom file input was replaced with `react-dropzone`, a stable and well-tested library for handling file uploads. This provides a better user experience with drag-and-drop functionality.
2.  **Created a Reusable Component**: A new `ImageUploader.tsx` component was created to encapsulate all file handling logic, making it easy to reuse and maintain.
3.  **Corrected Project Structure**: The root `package.json` was reconfigured to use **npm Workspaces**. This resolved persistent "Module not found" errors by creating a proper monorepo structure and ensuring dependencies for the `frontend` and `backend` were installed and linked correctly.
4.  **Stabilized the Backend Server**: A `nodemon.json` configuration file was added to the backend to explicitly define which directories and files `nodemon` should monitor. This prevents the server from crashing when new images are uploaded.
5.  **Fixed File Type Validation**: The file filter on the backend was corrected to reliably accept all intended image MIME types (`jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `webp`).
6.  **Cleaned Up UI**: Removed all leftover debugging code and components (`ImageDebugger`) from the UI for a clean user experience.
