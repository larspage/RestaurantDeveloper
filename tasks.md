# Restaurant Developer Tasks

## Menu Management Implementation

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Enhanced `menuService.test.ts` with comprehensive error handling tests
- ✅ Updated `menuService.ts` with proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Added tests for edge cases (empty IDs, invalid data)
- ✅ Added validation for required fields in menu data
- ✅ Implemented proper error logging for API calls
- ✅ All tests are now passing (17/17)
- ✅ Added section reordering functionality with drag-and-drop
- ✅ Added section description editing
- ✅ Improved section delete confirmation with modal dialog
- ✅ Enhanced MenuItem interface to support image upload properties
- ✅ Added uploadItemImage method with progress tracking
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for image upload functionality

### Next Steps

#### Priority 1: Frontend Menu Management UI
1. **Menu Section Management**
   - ✅ Implement section reordering functionality
   - ✅ Add section description editing
   - ✅ Improve section delete confirmation UX

2. **Menu Item Management**
   - 🔄 Implement item image upload functionality
     - ✅ Create service layer for image uploads
     - ⏳ Create ImageUploader component with preview
     - ⏳ Integrate with menu item form
     - ⏳ Implement backend API endpoint for image uploads
   - ⏳ Add item modification options
   - ⏳ Implement item availability toggle with visual indicator

3. **JSON Import/Export Enhancements**
   - ⏳ Add schema validation with detailed error messages
   - ⏳ Implement preview functionality before import
   - ⏳ Add support for importing from various formats (CSV, etc.)

#### Priority 2: Integration Testing
1. **End-to-End Tests**
   - ⏳ Create Cypress tests for menu management workflows
   - ⏳ Test menu creation, editing, and deletion
   - ⏳ Test section and item management

2. **API Integration Tests**
   - ⏳ Verify frontend-backend integration for menu operations
   - ⏳ Test error handling and edge cases

#### Priority 3: Performance Optimization
1. **Menu Loading Performance**
   - ⏳ Implement pagination for large menus
   - ⏳ Add lazy loading for menu items
   - ⏳ Optimize API response size

2. **Database Optimization**
   - ⏳ Add indexes for frequently queried fields
   - ⏳ Optimize query patterns for menu operations

## Implementation Details

### Menu Service Enhancements
The menu service has been enhanced with:
- Input validation for all parameters
- Proper error handling with specific error messages
- Comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints
- Support for updating existing sections and items
- Support for section reordering
- Support for menu item image uploads with progress tracking

### Menu UI Enhancements
The menu management UI has been enhanced with:
- Drag-and-drop functionality for section reordering
- Inline editing for section descriptions
- Modal confirmation dialog for section deletion with item count warning

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all service methods
- Error handling tests for API failures
- Edge case testing for invalid inputs
- Integration tests for frontend-backend communication

## Complexity Level: Level 3
This implementation requires comprehensive planning and phased implementation due to:
- Complex UI interactions (drag and drop, image uploads)
- Data validation requirements
- Performance considerations for large menus
- Integration with multiple backend endpoints
